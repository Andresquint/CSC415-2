# CSC 415 - Project 1 - Hello World

## Student Name : Joe Binalinbing

## Student ID   : 918501338

## Build Instructions
We have a constant string defined "Joe Binalinbing."

The char "msg" array holds the strings.

We defined a local variable int bytes_formatted and bytes_written to hold library functions sprintf and write.

C does not provide direct support for error handling therefore we used conditions if statement after calling the functions.

## Run Instructions
I used windows subsystem for this project.

cd to the designated folder.

make

./hw
